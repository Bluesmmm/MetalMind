10. Refit the lid to the drum. Ensure that the drum remains ventilated.  

11.	 Wipe the filter chamber and top cover inside and out with isopropanol alcohol and a disposable cloth to remove any residue.   
12. To reduce system down time, Renishaw recommend that a second filter assembly is purchased. Drying time will depend upon ambient humidity and temperature - it is important that moisture is not introduced into the AM250/AM400 system. Recommended drying times (following a dry wipe) is 4 hours for the large safe change filter chamber and top cover.   
13.	 At the top of the filter chamber check the o-ring seal. Ensure it is fitted correctly. Ensure there are no signs of damage or deformation that will affect its ability to seal. Replace the o-ring as necessary (Figure 202).

# WARNING: NEVER RESTART AN AM250/AM400 SYSTEM WITHOUT A FILTER INSTALLED. NEVER RESTART AN AM250/AM400 SYSTEM WITH A USED FILTER.  

1. Open the packaging and remove the filter element.  

# WARNING: ENSURE THAT THE OPEN END OF THE FILTER ELEMENT IS AT THE OPEN END OFTHE FILTER CHAMBER.  

2. Fit the filter element into the filter chamber. The closed end of the filter element must be at the   
closed end of the filter chamber.   
3. Ensure the filter element is centred in the filter chamber.   
4. Refit the top cover to the filter chamber.   
5. Refit the six M5 bolts securing the top cover to the filter chamber.
