Relevant national legislation and internal company policies will dictate normal minimum requirements for health and safety.  

WARNING: OPERATION OF THE RENISHAW AM250/AM400 IS ONLY PERMITTED BYOPERATORS WHO HAVE COMPLETED A RENISHAW APPROVED TRAINING PROGRAM.  

WARNING: DO NOT OVERRIDE SAFETY INTERLOCKS AND CIRCUITS.  

Caution: Use of controls or adjustments or performance of procedures other than those specified herein may result in hazardous radiation exposure.  

# 6.1 Basic safety measures  

Risk assessments for all foreseeable hazards must be carried out prior to operating the system.  

All end user companies must undertake a full risk assessment to establish the requirement for additional measures such as a COSHH or DSEAR assessment (or the local equivalent). This will subsequently inform the provision of correct personal protective equipment and site operating conditions and procedures for safe use of the equipment, storage and handling of raw materials and waste product. Any ancillary equipment must be selected giving due consideration to these requirements.  

Governing bodies will differ depending upon geographic location, and the appropriate governmental and regulatory bodies must be identified for each territory. Considerations need to include regulations governing:  

The use of lasers. Fine metallic powders below $4 5 \mu \mathrm { m }$ (0.002 in) diameter. The use, storage and monitoring of inert gas. • Small quantities of waste product including nano soot particles captured by the filter system.  

Review all data sheets (especially Safety Data Sheets) containing information about the metal powder(s) being used in the AM250/AM400 system.  

By following the correct procedures, it is possible for most powder handling to be executed under an inert atmosphere; however measures must be taken to minimise exposure to any airborne metallic powder produced during the handling and processing of builds by the use of the appropriate personal protective equipment and other equipment as the components are removed from the system.  

If in doubt about the health and safety issues and your legal obligations, our recommendation is to engage the services of a competent person.  

# 6.2 Safety signs  

Various safety signs are fixed to the AM250/AM400. These are described below.  

<html><body><table><tr><td> Safety sign</td><td>Description and location</td></tr><tr><td>WARNING</td><td>Warning - ISOLATE SUPPLY BEFORE OPENING COVER.

# 6.3 General note on eye protection  

In normal use laser operation, the main chamber door is interlocked.  

Potential for Class 4 laser emissions.  

# WARNING: DO NOT OVERRIDE SAFETY INTERLOCKS.  

During any adjustment or maintenance with the laser on and the chamber door open, laser eyewear MUST BE WORN, as specified in EN 207 (EN 58215) which provides protection against laser beams with wavelengths of $1 0 0 0 \mu \mathrm { m }$ to $1 1 0 0 \mu \mathrm { m }$ . Failure to do so may result in permanent irreparable eye damage.  

Any maintenance MUST be carried out by a suitably qualified person.  

WARNING: ON AM250 FITTED WITH PLUSPAC AND AM400 THERE IS AN LED LIGHTASSEMBLY FITTED TO THE TOP OF THE BUILD CHAMBER. DO NOT STARE AT THE LED LIGHTASSEMBLY AS IT MAY BE HARMFUL TO THE EYES.  

# 7 Laser warning labelling  

In order to comply with international standards, the Renishaw AM250/AM400 carries various safety warning labels regarding the emission of laser light. These labels form part of the safety information and it is recommended that users regularly (we suggest weekly) check the condition and presence of the labels in the locations shown in the following images. Many labels are generic and fitted to both AM250 and AM400, but some labels are specific to AM250 and some are specific to AM400.  

Replacement warning labels can be ordered from Renishaw.  

Laser power is classified the higher the class number, the greater the laser radiation hazard. Refer to international standard IEC 60825 for details.  

The Renishaw AM250/AM400 in normal operation with the build chamber door closed, is classified as Class 1 according to the Standard EN 60825-1, edition: 2014, Safety of Laser Equipment – Part 1.  

A summary of the standard is as follows:  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Laser class</td><td>Definition</td></tr><tr><td>Class 1</td><td>Output power is below the level at which it is believed eye damage will occur. May contain laser systems of a higher Class with adequate engineering control measures to ensure that access to the beam is not reasonably likely.</td></tr><tr><td>Class 1M</td><td>Can be harmful to the eye if the beam is viewed using magnifying optical instruments.</td></tr><tr><td>Class 2</td><td>More powerful than class 1, natural aversion (blink response) should terminate the eye exposure before eye damage can occur. Repeated, deliberate exposure to the laser beam may not be safe.</td></tr><tr><td>Class 2M</td><td>Similar to a Class 2 laser product. However, these products can be harmful to the eye if the beam is viewed using magnifying optical instruments or for long periods of time.</td></tr><tr><td>Class 3R</td><td>Users must avoid viewing the beam directly. Although the risk of eye injury is low the power exceeds the maximum permissible exposure for accidental viewing and can potentially cause eye injuries.</td></tr><tr><td>Class 3B</td><td>Class 3B lasers may have sufficient power to cause an eye injury, both from the direct beam and from reflections.</td></tr><tr><td>Class 4</td><td>Class 4 lasers are capable of causing injury to both the eye and skin and may also presenta fire hazard.</td></tr></table></body></html>
