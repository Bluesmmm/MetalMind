Fit a new filter (part number 792460000 - AM250 and part number M13FPFK - AM400).  

Fit the cleaned filter assembly back into the AM250/AM400 system.  

# 33.4 Gas safety checks  

Carry out a safety check of the gas system and ensure it is in working condition with no leaks. Replace and damaged or defective parts as required. Keep records of when the gas safety check is carried out.  

# WARNING: GAS REGULATORS CANNOT BE CALIBRATED AND MUST BE REPLACED AT THE END OF THEIR LIFETIME. THE LIFETIME IS DETERMINED BY THE MANUFACTURER OF THE REGULATOR BUT IS TYPICALLY FIVE YEARS.  

# 33.5 Powder safety checks  

Renishaw recommend that you develop a maintenance regime for your powder, powder storage and powder handling areas. Periodically check that powder is being stored correctly in line with applicable Safety Data Sheets and powder suppliers recommendations. Periodically powder storage and handling areas must be deep cleaned to remove all powder traces. Metal powder is very fine and can find its way into very small spaces where it can accumulate with the consequential risk of explosion. Deep cleaning of areas and equipment, including but not restricted to trunking, ducting, ceiling tiles, flooring, furniture, etc must be done to remove all traces of powder.  

# 33.6 AM250/AM400 system batteries  

The AM250/AM400 system contains a number of non-rechargeable lithium batteries. These batteries have a shelf life of 5 years (at $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ ), however replacement is recommended at least every 3 years.  

WARNING: BEFORE CARRYING OUT ANY MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES ON THE AM250/AM400 SYSTEM THAT REQUIRES OPENING THE ELECTRICAL CABINET OR REMOVING THE PC, THE AM250/AM400 SYSTEM MUST BE ELECTRICALLY ISOLATED, AND CAPACITORS ALLOWED TO DISCHARGE. WHEN OPENING THE PC OR HANDLING PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARDS ESD PRECAUTIONS SHOULD BE CARRIED OUT – EITHER TOUCH A GROUNDED PIECE OF METAL TO DISCHARGE STATIC ELECTRICITY FROM YOUR BODY, OR USE A GROUNDING WRIST STRAP.  

The lithium batteries provide power to the backup memory of system parameters and settings, removing a battery may wipe the backup memory. Ensure backup data is available.  

WARNING: CAUTION SHOULD BE TAKEN WHEN HANDLING AND DISPOSING OF BATTERIES:DO FOLLOW BATTERY DISPOSAL ADVICE AND ANY INTERNAL WASTE MANAGEMENTPROCESSES AND PROCEDURES.  
DO NOT EXPOSE THE BATTERIES TO HIGH TEMPERATURES INCLUDING DIRECT SUNLIGHTOR INCINERATE.  
DO NOT TRY TO RECHARGE A PRIMARY (NON-RECHARGEABLE) CELL.  
DO NOT CRUSH, DISASSEMBLE BREAK OPEN OR ABUSE THE BATTERIES.  
NEVER USE A BATTERY THAT HAS BEEN DROPPED ON THE FLOOR OR OTHERWISESUBJECT TO SHOCK AS IT MAY LEAK.  
DO NOT SHORT-CIRCUIT THE BATTERY.  

Renishaw recommend that batteries are only replaced by experienced technicians.

# 33.7 Decommissioning  

There are no known residual risks associated with the AM250/AM400 systems. However when decommissioning the system the following steps must be taken:  

Inert and remove the safe change/large safe change filter/filters • Remove all powder, clear the system of powder and clean to remove any residual powder  

WARNING: ENSURE YOU ARE WEARING THE CORRECT PPE: EYE PROTECTION, FULL FACE RESPIRATOR (TO EN143 TYPE $p 3 + A 1$ ), PROTECTIVE GLOVES AND FULL LENGTH CLOTHING, (MADE FROM NON-STATIC GENERATING FABRIC SUCH AS COTTON (AVOID WOOL AND MAN MADE FABRICS) AND AVOID TURN-UPS OR POCKETS THAT MAY TRAP POWDER, REFER TO NFPA 484 FOR DETAILS) BEFORE STARTING THIS TASK.  

Clean the system of any residual dirt/process emissions Shut off the inert gas supply and open the gas inlet valve to depressurise the system Remove the inert gas supply hose Follow the PC shutdown procedure Isolate electrical power to the AM250/AM400 system • Drain down the system coolant, refer to any applicable PPE requirements  

# REFER TO ANY APPLICABLE PPE REQUIREMENTS FOR HANDLING SYSTEM COOLANT.  

AM400 only disconnect the dehumidifier supply hoses  

It is the users responsibility to document the powder types that have been used in the system and highlight any that may pose a residual risk.  

Contact Renishaw for packaging, and relocation or disposal guidance.
