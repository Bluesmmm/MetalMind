# 14.5 Dehumidifier  

The AM400 requires a supply of temperature-controlled air to keep some of the optical components at a stable temperature.  

Regular checks are required to ensure that the dehumidifier functions correctly and continues to supply temperature-controlled air to the optical system, see Section 37 Appendix D "Supplier manuals" for information on the make, model and manufacturer.  

Caution: The dehumidifier and laser optics require a reliable compressed air supply. This should be checked regularly.  

# 15 Argon supply connection and changeover  

The AM250/AM400 requires a supply of inert gas in order to safely process the raw material. The AM250/AM400 will run from either mains supply or bottled argon, the following procedure covers gas cylinders.  

A minimum cylinder pressure of approximately 25 bar (363 psi) is recommended at the start of any build. If the argon supply is depleted, the build process will pause and an alarm will sound. Depending on the expected build duration it may be prudent to exchange for a full argon cylinder.  

WARNING: ARGON GAS CYLINDERS CAN BE HEAVY. ENSURE GAS CYLINDERS ARE CORRECTLY SECURED TO PREVENT THEM FROM FALLING OVER. USE SUITABLE EQUIPMENT AND PROCESSES TO MOVE CYLINDERS. CONSIDER CONTACTING YOUR ARGON GAS SUPPLIER FOR EQUIPMENT, INFORMATION AND ADVICE ON HANDLING GAS CYLINDERS.  

# WARNING: TAKE SUITABLE PRECAUTIONS WHEN HANDLING PRESSURISED GAS BOTTLES.  

# 15.1 Removing and re-installing the gas cylinder  

Note: The following photographs and text describe a typical gas cylinder available in the UK. The size and type of gas cylinder, and gas regulator will be different in the geographic area where your AM250/ AM400 machine is located.  

Close the argon gas cylinder valve by rotating it clockwise (Figure 114).

Figure 114 Close cylinder valve  

Detach the regulator from the gas valve using a $1 \%$ in (approximately $2 9 \mathsf { m m }$ ) or adjustable spanner, (Figure 115).

Figure 115 Unscrew regulator from the cylinder  

Remove the empty gas cylinder, store securely, by chaining it in the designated storage location.  

Install a full gas cylinder in the designated location near the system, and secure appropriately (Figure 116).

Figure 116 Secure the gas cylinder  

Attach the regulator to the cylinder valve using a $1 \%$ in (approximately $2 9 \mathsf { m m }$ ) or adjustable spanner (Figure 117).  

WARNING: NEVER USE OIL OR GREASE, SEALING COMPOUNDS OR TAPES ON THE GAS CYLINDER CONNECTIONS.

Figure 117 Attach regulator  

Open the argon gas valve by unscrewing the valve completely (anti-clockwise), then back off by screwing clockwise half a turn.  

Regulate the supply pressure to between 1.5 bar and 1.8 bar (22 psi to 26 psi) (Figure 118).  

![](images/ddb9be1515d3731894a89d74165a4614f93da4866160497c98627b1a5b4666fd.jpg)  
Figure 118 Left gauge shows supply pressure, right gauge cylinder pressure.  

# WARNING: DO NOT EXCEED 2 BAR (29 PSI) LINE PRESSURE WHEN REGULATING ARGON GAS. OVERPRESSURE WILL CAUSE THE SYSTEM TO HALT  

Clockwise on the regulator valve will increase the pressure (Figure 119).

Figure 119 Rotate regulator right to increase supply pressure  

A minimum cylinder pressure of approximately 25 bar (363 psi) is recommended at the start of any build. If the argon supply is depleted, the build process will pause and an alarm will sound.  

Test the installation as follows to ensure there are no leaks of argon gas. Ensure the AM250/AM400 valves are closed. Pressurise the supply hoses to 1.8 bar, close the regulator, wait ten minutes, ensure the supply hose pressure on the gauge has not dropped. Open the regulator and pressurise to 1.8 bar.  

# 16.1 Powering on the system  

WARNING: BEFORE SWITCHING ON – ENSURE THE SYSTEM DOOR IS CLOSED.  

WARNING: ALWAYS CHECK THE CHILLER AND DEHUMIDIFIER HAVE BEEN SWITCHED ON BEFORE STARTING THE AM250/AM400. SEE SECTIONS 16.2 "POWERING ON THE CHILLER" AND SECTION 16.3 "POWERING ON THE DEHUMIDIFIER".  

The equipment main isolator switch is mounted on the right hand side of the AM250/AM400 cabinet. Switch the main isolator to ON or 1 (Figure 120), when the reset button illuminates, press it. The controller and the main computer will then begin the start-up routine.  

![](images/9e805d4c26eeae7627f147825c405ac584529e90e0b75d9a8859fe0b47884c6b.jpg)  
Figure 120 Main isolator switch  

The chiller, process heating system and laser will also be enabled when the main isolator is switched on.  

When the controller and main computer are booted, the system is ready for operation. This is indicated by the welcome screen (Figure 121).

This will begin the shutdown sequence for the control PC, after several seconds the PC communication alarm will show.  

Open the lower right door, then open the cover on the PC – once the green LED light has gone out the PC has been successfully shutdown (Figure 123).  

It is now safe to shut off power to the AM250/AM400 by turning the main isolator to 0 or OFF.  

Once the AM250/AM400 has been switched off, the chiller can also be switched off.  

# WARNING: DO NOT SWITCH OFF THE CHILLER WHILST THE SYSTEM IS STILL ON.

# 16.2 Powering on the chiller  

The AM250/AM400 requires a supply of temperature-controlled fluid to keep the optical components at a stable temperature.  

To switch on the chiller, ensure that the main power lead is connected to a suitable power supply, then switch on the main switch on the back of the unit (Figure 124). Press the RUN / STOP button once to switch on the pump, the run light will illuminate (Figure 124).  

Once the chiller is switched on, it can be set to run using the controls on the front panel circled below.   
The SV (Set Value) temperature should be set to $2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ $( 6 8 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { F } )$ (Figure 124).

If it is not 0, when the door is open the Zero Pressure Reading button will be visible. Pressing this will reset the pressure sensor.  

Note: An incorrect pressure reading may prevent the system from achieving the set pressure required to operate.  

Caution: An incorrect pressure reading may result in a build halting or failing.
