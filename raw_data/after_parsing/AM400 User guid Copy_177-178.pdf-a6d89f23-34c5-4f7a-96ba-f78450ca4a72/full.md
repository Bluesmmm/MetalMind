# 29 Removing the overflow bottle  

The following procedure applies to both the large overflow bottle and small powder bottle.  

WARNING: ENSURE YOU ARE WEARING THE CORRECT PPE: EYE PROTECTION, FULL FACE RESPIRATOR (TO EN143 TYPE $\mathsf { P 3 } + \mathsf { A 1 }$ ), PROTECTIVE GLOVES AND FULL LENGTH CLOTHING, (MADE FROM NON-STATIC GENERATING FABRIC SUCH AS COTTON (AVOID WOOL AND MAN MADE FABRICS) AND AVOID TURN-UPS OR POCKETS THAT MAY TRAP POWDER, REFER TO NFPA 484 FOR DETAILS) BEFORE STARTING THIS TASK.  

# WARNING: WHEN REMOVING OVERFLOW BOTTLES ENSURE THE ATEX VACUUM CLEANER (WET SEPARATOR) IS AVAILABLE TO REMOVE ANY TRACE AMOUNTS OF POWDER RELEASED WHEN SEPARATING KF FLANGES.  

Gently tap the overflow bottle until the remaining powder between the valves (A1 and V2 rear overflow) (B1 and V3 front overflow) has flowed into the bottle.  

Close both valves (A1 and V2 rear overflow) (B1 and V3 front overflow); pull the levers to unlock, and then rotate by $9 0 ^ { \circ }$ to a horizontal position (Figure 279 and Figure 280). Open the latch on the quick-release clamp (L10 rear and L13 front overflow) in the middle of the two valves (A1 and V2 rear overflow) (B1 and V3 front overflow). Swing one collar of the quick-release clamp (L10 rear and L13 front overflow) off the engaged KF flanges at a time (Figure 281).
