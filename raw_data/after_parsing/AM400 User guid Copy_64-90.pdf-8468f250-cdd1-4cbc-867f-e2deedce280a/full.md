# 14.1.1 Chiller cooling fluid level check  

The AM250/AM400 requires a supply of temperature-controlled fluid to keep the optical components at a stable temperature. The chiller is a closed-loop cooling circuit and has a direct communication connection to the system that allows status and warnings to be viewed via the HMI touch screen.  

Regular weekly checks are required to ensure that the chiller fluid level is maintained – it should not be allowed to drop below the L mark on the sight glass (Figure 61). The chiller cooling circuit can be filled with either Glycol or Nalco fluid. Using Glycol requires the use of a corrosion inhibitor / fungicide which is available from your local Renishaw office. Glycol is a concentrated solution and is mixed with purified filtered water at a concentration of $2 5 \%$ by volume. Description – Glycol chiller additive. Part number: P-HX04-0001. Nalco is supplied pre-mixed, does not require the use of any additional additives and should only be topped up with pre-mixed Nalco. Description – Nalco chiller additive. Part number: P-HX04-0003. Do not fill above the H mark on the sight glass. Do not mix the chiller fluids.  

In addition to this regular inspection, maintenance is required, refer to the recommendations in the manufacturers service manual, see Section 37 "Supplier manuals" for information on the make, model and manufacturer. There are two sizes of chiller, the chiller supplied depends upon the AM system supplied.

Figure 65 Recommended temperature parameters  

Check the fluid levels are within the H (maximum) and L (minimum) markings, (Figure 66). If required top-up with chiller fluid, this is either Glycol or Nalco. Do not mix the chiller fluids together.  

Glycol $2 5 \%$ , (part number P-HX04-0001) mixed with purified filtered water Nalco pre-mixed, (part number P-HX04-0003)  

Do not fill above the H mark on the sight glass.  

To ensure efficient use of the chiller for the AM250/AM400 system, these tasks should be completed on a monthly basis.  

Caution: Only mix Glycol with purified filtered water. DO NOT mix Glycol with any other type of water. Do not mix Glycol with de-ionised, de-mineralised, tap or plant water. Nalco is supplied pre-mixed and does not need water adding.

# 14.2 ATEX vacuum cleaner (wet separator)  

WARNING: DO NOT STORE THE ATEX VACUUM CLEANER (WET SEPARATOR) IN A CLOSED UNVENTILATED SPACE. ALWAYS MAINTAIN THE ATEX VACUUM CLEANER (WET SEPARATOR) IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE MANUFACTURER’S INSTRUCTIONS. NEVER USE AN INAPPROPRIATE VACUUM CLEANER TO CLEAN AWAY POWDER OR WASTE PRODUCT.  

WARNING: IN AREAS WHERE POWDER IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE PRESENT BUT MAY BE PRESENT FOR SHORT PERIODS ALL EQUIPMENT IN THAT AREA (INCLUDING PORTABLE) MUST BE ELECTRICALLY BONDED AND EARTHED. IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT ALL PORTABLE EQUIPMENT IS FITTED WITH STATIC-DISSIPATIVE WHEELS, AND IT IS ALSO GOOD PRACTICE TO GROUND WITH AN EXTERNAL GROUND WIRE. CONSIDER CREATING AN ATEX ZONE 22 OR NFPA 484 IN HANDLING AREAS SUCH AS SIEVING, DECANTING, AND DE-BUILD.  

WARNING: VACUUM NOZZLES, HOSES AND FITTINGS MUST BE CONDUCTIVE (ELECTROSTATIC-DISSIPATIVE) AND NON-SPARKING. NEVER USE INSULATING PLASTIC, DOMESTIC NOZZLES, OR MAKE ANY UNAPPROVED MODIFICATIONS. IT IS RECOMMENDED TO CLEARLY MARK ESD VACUUM FITTINGS (WITH YELLOW TAPE AND AN ESD SYMBOL) TO ENSURE THEY CAN NOT BE MIXED WITH NON-ESD PLASTIC FITTINGS.  

WARNING: COMPONENTS/SUBSTRATES BEING VACUUMED MUST BE EARTHED. PRACTICALLY THIS CAN BE ACHIEVED BY CONSTRUCTING BENCHTOPS AND WORKTOPS FROM CONDUCTIVE MATERIAL (NON-SPARKING METAL, FOR EXAMPLE ALUMINIUM OR ESD MATTING) WHICH IS EARTHED. METALLIC BENCHES MUST BE EARTHED. IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT SUPPLEMENTARY BONDING IS FITTED BETWEEN THE VACUUM AND OBJECT BEING VACUUMED (SUBSTRATE PLATE, BENCH TOP OR AM SYSTEM). RENISHAW OR RUWAC CAN PROVIDE A SUPPLEMENTARY BONDING LEAD (RUWAC PART NUMBER 59803 FOR NA7 OR 68134 FOR NA35).  

WARNING: A REGULAR INSPECTION, TESTING, AND MAINTENANCE PROGRAM INCLUDING TESTING OF ELECTRICAL CONTINUITY (BONDING BETWEEN PIECES OF EQUIPMENT) AND EARTHING/GROUNDING (RESISTANCE TO GROUND) MUST BE PUT IN PLACE AND RECORDS KEPT. ESD DISSIPATIVE MATERIALS HAVE A RESISTANCE OF $\bullet \bullet ^ { 6 }$ AND $1 0 ^ { 8 }$ OHMS. THE LOWER LIMIT ( $1 0 ^ { 6 }$ OHMS) IS SPECIFIED TO PROTECT PERSONNEL FROM ELECTROCUTION DUE TO INADVERTENT CONTACT WITH ENERGIZED ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT, WHILST THE UPPER RESISTANCE LIMIT ( $1 0 ^ { 8 }$ OHMS) IS SPECIFIED TO ENSURE ADEQUATE CHARGE DISSIPATION.  

WARNING: AS MUCH POWDER AS POSSIBLE MUST BE REMOVED WITHIN THE AM250/AM400BUILD CHAMBER. WHERE PRACTICAL POWDER MUST BE SWEPT UP USING NON-SPARKINGRECEPTACLES AND BRUSHES WITH NATURAL FIBRE BRISTLES (NON-STATIC GENERATING).VACUUMING IS ONLY PERMITTED FOR RESIDUAL POWDER THAT CAN NOT BE REMOVEDUSING THE PREVIOUS METHODS. DO NOT USE COMPRESSED AIR FOR POWDER REMOVALOR CLEANING AS IT WILL GENERATE A DUST SUSPENSION.  

WARNING: THESE ACTIONS DO NOT CONSTITUTE A FULL ASSESSMENT OF RISK. USERS MUST SATISFY THEMSELVES THAT THE INSTALLATION STANDARDS AND WORKING PRACTICES ARE SUITABLE. THE FOLLOWING STANDARDS SHOULD BE REFERRED TO: ATEX, NFPA 77, NFPA 484.  

The Renishaw AM system requires the use of an ATEX vacuum cleaner (wet separator) to clean away small remnants of material and waste process emissions. These materials are potentially dangerous and the appropriate procedures as detailed in this manual must be observed.  

Two main hazards exist:  

1. The potential for powder explosion due to static charge caused by powder in suspension. To control and mitigate this hazard, an ATEX vacuum cleaner (wet separator) is used to extinguish any potential ignition whilst the material is vacuumed.   
2. The use of water potentially causes a secondary hazard with some materials, where the reaction between the material and water causes a chemical reaction that can lead to the generation of hydrogen gas which is volatile. a. To control and mitigate this hazard, the ATEX vacuum cleaner (wet separator) features a ventilation valve which remains normally open when the cleaner is not being used. b. For the ventilation valve to function effectively, it is essential to store the ATEX vacuum cleaner (wet separator) in a well ventilated area. c. Use of a $5 \%$ solution of Hydra-Sol-MAG additive (P-LU08-0004) in the ATEX vacuum cleaner (wet separator) will help to inhibit the generation of hydrogen.  

The Renishaw supplied and approved ATEX vacuum cleaner (wet separator) is a Ruwac NA7 (Figure 34) (earlier installations may also be using the Ruwac NA35).  

The manufacturer’s user manual for the Ruwac NA7 is supplied, and should be read before use. Key points are listed below:  

# 14.2.1 ATEX vacuum cleaner (wet separator) safety checks  

![](images/12cd7f4c32f6c30d44806c9cfb66fac48abfc5acb45ccb7a1f43726b26b508f3.jpg)  

Ensure the ATEX vacuum cleaner (wet separator) is electrically earthed.   
< 106 Ohms between plug and components.   
< 1 MOhm for conductive components.   
< 108 Ohms for dissipative parts. Check fluid level is correct before every start-up, and top-up as necessary.   
Ensure correct additives are used.  

![](images/3f6407dae41095aec063858ce3ffe01f64c5656c18aba9702c0adbaf585710cc.jpg)  

![](images/b4f6b4e2db569392d94f8537a004757dfa0d307e8ecec4c6a4803ab696d9bc0a.jpg)  

Check the hydrogen ventilation valve(s) work before start-up by pressing and ensuring they spring back (open).  

![](images/76446d6917ecd905d393f884f2eeb55d7f5b6c86ce98383d7469f47e45e09b53.jpg)  

Ensure the ATEX vacuum cleaner (wet separator) is emptied and cleaned after every shift.  

These checks must be carried out on both the Ruwac NA35 and NA7 models.  

Ensure the ATEX vacuum cleaner (wet separator) is electrically earthed.  

Check the earth continuity between each of the components that come into contact with powder against each other. Check the resistance of the plug earthing (largest diameter pin) against the body. If a reading greater than 1 MOhm (open circuit) is detected between any component, the unit must be disassembled and checked.  

Ruwac recommends that an insulation tester is used with a voltage of $2 5 0 \vee$ ; however a low voltage multimeter should be sufficient. Renishaw recommends that this is checked at least after every disassembly or weekly if no disassembly occurs.  

Ensure the fluid level is checked before every start-up and the correct additives are used.  

This can be easily checked through the window of the Ruwac NA7, however the NA35 must be disassembled to check.  

Users must have completed the appropriate Renishaw training course before handling oxygen reactive metals. Among other recommendations this will specify the need to add a $5 \%$ solution of Hydra-SolMAG additive (part number P-LU08-0004) to the Ruwac ATEX vacuum cleaner (wet separator).  

![](images/727548cd9e471d0037c1ac1b94249dc1ccaa153665a5b2c93650c099f7c77ef3.jpg)  
Figure 67 Ruwac NA7 ATEX vacuum cleaner (wet separator)  

Depending on the metal powder (particularly aluminium alloy) and local water hardness it may also be necessary to add $0 . 1 \%$ by volume of anti-foaming agent (part number 792322000). It is essential that foam is not allowed to build up as it will be drawn into the cleaner resulting in corrosion.  

Ensure the ventilation valve(s) are checked before start-up  

Note that the ventilation valve is designed to close when in use. First, turn off the Ruwac ATEX vacuum cleaner (wet separator). Push the inner disk (Figure 68 and Figure 69). It should move approximately $5 \mathsf { m m }$ and spring back (open) – if no movement is detected the valve is stuck. Immediately quarantine the Ruwac ATEX vacuum cleaner (wet separator) by placing it in a well ventilated area away from possible ignition sources.  

Contact Renishaw for replacement parts.  

Ensure the ATEX vacuum cleaner (wet separator) is emptied and cleaned after every shift. This will limit the time that the oxygen reactive metal is in contact with water. Waste water must be stored in a vented drum in a well ventilated area (preferably outdoors) until it can be recycled.

# 14.3 Renishaw powder recovery system (sieve)  

WARNING: ENSURE YOU ARE WEARING THE CORRECT PPE: EYE PROTECTION, FULL FACE RESPIRATOR (TO EN143 TYPE $\mathsf { P 3 } \plus \mathsf { A 1 }$ ), PROTECTIVE GLOVES AND FULL LENGTH CLOTHING, (MADE FROM NON-STATIC GENERATING FABRIC SUCH AS COTTON (AVOID WOOL AND MAN MADE FABRICS) AND AVOID TURN-UPS OR POCKETS THAT MAY TRAP POWDER, REFER TO NFPA 484 FOR DETAILS) BEFORE STARTING THIS TASK.  

Note: To minimise the risk from Argon leakage Renishaw recommend using a small argon gas cylinder of approximately 1000 L (35 cu/ft). Renishaw also recommend using a trigger type gas valve to prevent the gas supply being accidently left on.  

WARNING: WHEN IN OPERATION THE BODY OF THE SIEVE MOVES RELATIVE TO THESUPPORT FRAME. THERE IS A POSSIBILITY OF BODY PARTS BECOMING TRAPPEDBETWEEN THE SIEVE BODY AND SUPPORT FRAME. ENSURE HANDS ETC ARE KEPT AWAYFROM THE SIEVE WHEN IT IS IN OPERATION.  

# 14.3.1 Attaching the argon supply  

The sieve station has a gas supply port, which can be connected to an argon supply. This is essential for oxygen reactive metals (titanium for example). This should be regulated to 0.1 bar (1.5 psi). The sieve is ATEX rated to run containing air, however the properties of oxygen reactive metals may be affected by doing so. Ensure the argon supply line is connected to the sieve (Figure 70).  

![](images/ddc9fa80c2b414ed323c39df860f40c93ce17bd9320222a6da65c57423a583c4.jpg)  
Figure 70 Sieve with argon inlet attached  

Place an o-ring seal on an empty powder bottle. Engage the empty powder bottle KF flange to the bottom flange of the sieve assembly and seal the connection using a quick-release clamp (SL6) (Figure 71).  

Open the valves of both sieve assembly (S2) and empty bottle (A1) to complete connection (levers aligned with direction of flow) (Figure 72).  

Open the argon valve and ensure it is regulated to 0.05 bar to 0.15 bar (0.7 psi to 2.2 psi).

# 14.3.6 Operating instructions for Russell clamp assist tool  

The Russell Clamp, (Figure 111) has been developed to assist the operator in setting the correct clamping force on hand-operated sieve clamps. It is for use on both under-clamps and toggle-clamps fitted onto the Russel Finex range of sieves. It has been preset to enable the operator to apply the correct torque setting by hand.

# 14.4.1 Operating instructions  

WARNING: BEFORE USING THE SILO LIFT, IT IS THE USERS RESPONSIBILITY TO COMPLYWITH LOCAL LIFTING LEGISLATION, TO CARRY OUT A RISK ASSESSMENT AND TO ENSURETHAT THE SILO LIFT IS SUITABLE FOR THE TASK FOR WHICH IT HAS BEEN PURCHASED. NOFORMAL LICENCE OR TRAINING IS REQUIRED TO OPERATE THE SILO LIFT, BUT RENISHAWSTRONGLY ADVISE FAMILIARISATION TRAINING IS CARRIED OUT.  

Before using the silo lift, ensure that all functions are working correctly. • Never exceed the maximum permissible load for the silo lift and comply strictly with the requirements of the load diagram, on any equipment supplied. • Ensure that the load is evenly distributed. • Ensure that your silo lift is the correct type for the area you are to work in. Do not enter a hazardous zone with an unsuitable silo lift. • Do not carry divisible loads that sit higher than the fork carriage or backrest extension. • Keep a safe stopping distance. Laden silo lifts cannot be stopped as quickly. • If the silo lift develops a fault or feels unsafe, suspend operations, park and report. • The silo lift should not be left unattended on a gradient. • Be cautious of overhead limitations or obstructions.  

# Driving and braking  

The silo lift is not fitted with any kind of drive or braking devices and so driving and braking are both controlled by the operator pushing the silo lift. The rear castors are fitted with foot brakes for parking purposes.  

# Loading  

The forks are specifically designed to securely locate a silo, ensure the silo is pushed against the dead-stops, and fork tips located correctly.  

When using the plate for general purpose lifting ensure it is fixed in place and the load appropriately located.  

# Lifting  

Operate the manual hand pump by moving the pump handle lever backwards and forward at full stroke. Lift is achieved by each stroke of the handle.  

# Lowering  

Open the manual control valve by turning the release lever anti-clockwise.  

This lever can be set at any required angle by depressing the top button and revolving. It will lock automatically once the button has been released.  

Note: The speed of lowering can be controlled directly through the degree of turn of the knob, the valve will spring shut once the lever is released and lowering will halt.  

Caution: Always apply the wheel brakes when lifting or lowering a load.  

# 14.4.2 Rated capacity  

WARNING: DO NOT EXCEED THE LIFT’S RATED CAPACITY OF 200 KG AT 200 MM (440 LB AT 8 IN).  

# 14.4.3 Regular inspection and maintenance  

Every user shall ensure that work equipment is maintained in an efficient state, in efficient working order and in good repair.  

Every user shall ensure that where any system has a maintenance log, the maintenance log is kept up to date.  

It is important that equipment is maintained so that its performance does not deteriorate to the extent that it puts people at risk. Efficient relates to how the condition of the equipment might affect health and safety. It is not concerned with productivity.  

Lifting equipment needs to be checked frequently to ensure that safety-related features are functioning correctly. The frequency of checks/inspection and maintenance should take into account the duty cycle.  

Maintenance should only be carried out by a suitably qualified person, if in doubt contact Renishaw.

# 14.5 Dehumidifier  

The AM400 requires a supply of temperature-controlled air to keep some of the optical components at a stable temperature.  

Regular checks are required to ensure that the dehumidifier functions correctly and continues to supply temperature-controlled air to the optical system, see Section 37 Appendix D "Supplier manuals" for information on the make, model and manufacturer.  

Caution: The dehumidifier and laser optics require a reliable compressed air supply. This should be checked regularly.
