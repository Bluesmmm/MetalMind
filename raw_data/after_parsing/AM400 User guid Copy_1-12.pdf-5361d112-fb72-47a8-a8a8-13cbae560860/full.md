The user is cautioned that any changes or modifications not expressly approved by Renishaw plc or authorised representative could void the user’s authority to operate the equipment.  

# 1.8.2 47CFR section 15.105  

This equipment has been tested and found to comply with the limits for a Class A digital device, pursuant to part 15 of the FCC Rules. These limits are designed to provide reasonable protection against harmful interference when the equipment is operated in a commercial environment. This equipment generates, uses, and can radiate radio frequency energy and, if not installed and used in accordance with the instruction manual, may cause harmful interference to radio communications. Operation of this equipment in a residential area is likely to cause harmful interference in which case the user will be required to correct the interference at his own expense.  

The following section gives details of the equipment supplied with the system, and the equipment available as options.  

# 2.1 Summary  

The Renishaw additive manufacturing process creates homogeneous solid metal components, using high-powered laser energy to melt fine powder, manufacturing parts directly from 3D CAD data.  

This manual covers basic system operation and the relevant safety procedures for many commercially available materials. Users should be aware that raw materials used by the system require tightly controlled safety and handling protocols to be adhered to.  

Additionally, the system must only be operated by staff who have followed a Renishaw approved training course, and in accordance with the instructions and advice contained in this manual. If in doubt about the particular requirements of the Renishaw AM250/AM400 system for a specific material, please contact us for advice and guidance.
