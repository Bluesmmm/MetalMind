Similarly, if skin is exposed, e procedure indicated in e Safety Data Sheet should be followed. 4. If large quantities of powder are inhaled, e procedure indicated in e Safety Data Sheet should be followed. Metal powders burn rapidly and at elevated temperatures and can produce very noxious gases. Metal powder in layers or in bulk may catch fire and burn if subject to a sufficiently energetic ignition source. Airborne suspensions above e limits indicated in e Safety Data Sheet can pose a dust explosion hazard. Minimum ignition values for a range of powders are available on request. Do not place yourself at risk. In all cases when tackling a fire, e first action is to call e emergency services. At all stages, e fire-fighting method must be appropriate for e material concerned and e Safety Data Sheet should be consulted before assigning particular fire-fighting equipment to e areas where e materials are stored and used.
