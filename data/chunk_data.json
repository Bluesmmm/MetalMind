This will subsequently inform the provision of correct personal protective equipment and site operating conditions and procedures for safe use of the equipment, storage and handling of raw materials and waste product. Any ancillary equipment must be selected giving due consideration to these requirements.  \n\nGoverning bodies will differ depending upon geographic location, and the appropriate governmental and regulatory bodies must be identified for each territory. Considerations need to include regulations governing:  \n\nThe use of lasers. Fine metallic powders below $4 5 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ (0.002 in) diameter. The use, storage and monitoring of inert gas. • Small quantities of waste product including nano soot particles captured by the filter system.  \n\nReview all data sheets (especially Safety Data Sheets) containing information about the metal powder(s) being used in the AM250/AM400 system.  \n\nBy following the correct procedures, it is possible for most powder handling to be executed under an inert atmosphere; however measures must be taken to minimise exposure to any airborne metallic powder produced during the handling and processing of builds by the use of the appropriate personal protective equipment and other equipment as the components are removed from the system.  \n\nIf in doubt about the health and safety issues and your legal obligations, our recommendation is to engage the services of a competent person.  \n\n# 6.2 Safety signs  \n\nVarious safety signs are fixed to the AM250/AM400.

These labels form part of the safety information and it is recommended that users regularly (we suggest weekly) check the condition and presence of the labels in the locations shown in the following images. Many labels are generic and fitted to both AM250 and AM400, but some labels are specific to AM250 and some are specific to AM400.  \n\nReplacement warning labels can be ordered from Renishaw.  \n\nLaser power is classified the higher the class number, the greater the laser radiation hazard. Refer to international standard IEC 60825 for details.  \n\nThe Renishaw AM250/AM400 in normal operation with the build chamber door closed, is classified as Class 1 according to the Standard EN 60825-1, edition: 2014, Safety of Laser Equipment – Part 1.  \n\nA summary of the standard is as follows:  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Laser class</td><td>Definition</td></tr><tr><td>Class 1</td><td>Output power is below the level at which it is believed eye damage will occur. May contain laser systems of a higher Class with adequate engineering control measures to ensure that access to the beam is not reasonably likely.</td></tr><tr><td>Class 1M</td><td>Can be harmful to the eye if the beam is viewed using magnifying optical instruments.</td></tr><tr><td>Class 2</td><td>More powerful than class 1, natural aversion (blink response) should terminate the eye exposure before eye damage can occur. Repeated, deliberate exposure to the laser beam may not be safe.</td></tr><tr><td>Class 2M</td><td>Similar to a Class 2 laser product. However, these products can be harmful to the eye if the beam is viewed using magnifying optical instruments or for long periods of time.</td></tr><tr><td>"

    "content": "[gMASK] <sop> # 31.1 Introduction  \n\nIt is outside the scope of this user guide to define heat treatment methods and processes for AM parts once they have been built. However the following considerations should be made:  \n\nThick sections may have higher stress and require a normalisation or annealing heat treatment. Builds with a large cross sectional area will have a longer period between laser passes and require heat treatment. Some materials, such as titanium alloy may have higher internal stress following build and require heat treatment as soon as the build finishes. • Almost all alloys will oxidise at elevated temperatures. It is essential that heat treatment is carried out under vacuum or inert gas. For metals that are susceptible to nitrogen embrittlement it is essential that the inert gas is argon (titanium and INCONEL® for example). Renishaw can supply furnace foil wrap (part number 845500000). This is used to provide an extra layer of protection when used in conjunction with an inert gas box.  \n\nFor detailed furnace programming and operating instructions, refer to the User guide for your furnace and applicable local procedures.  \n\n# 31.2 Wrapping parts prior to heat treatment  \n\nRenishaw recommends that parts are wrapped in furnace foil wrap as follows:  \n\nEnsure enough foil is used to wrap the part, (Figure 348).  \n\n![](images/7b4973d928a1078cdedafa56bb014b7751d0c764ffe44399a68ec4db6fad678c.jpg)  \nFigure 348 Amount of foil to wrap the part  \n\nFold and cover approximately $^ 1 / _ { 4 }$ of the part, (Figure 349).  \n\n![](images/962ea99e5bc7ef6bdd46a3da91331411d685e13c7099ca8144052e39b6278ed9.jpg)  \nFigure 349 Fold and cover  \n\nFlip the part over and fold the remaining foil under, (Figure 350).  \n\n![](images/5f6cbeb27a5a92d48f4ab06201c3ceb6c30a0e9761bf53d306e821d8bf5ac096.jpg)  \nFigure 350 Fold remaining foil under  \n\nCrimp any open ends of the foil parcel, (Figure 351).  \n\n![](images/cad65f5d0985f57a87d7c902fbc0c52c541d1d76ba813f6f1b8324a3e051d1c8.jpg)  \nFigure 351 Crimp any open ends  \n\nFlip the part over again, (Figure 352).  \n\n![](images/3990656edc63f8"

Materials vary, but broadly the requirements are a particle size distribution of $1 5 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ to $4 5 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ with a mass-median-diameter $( { \\mathsf { d } } _ { 5 0 } )$ of $2 6 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ .  \n\nIt is recommended that the use of other metal powders is discussed in advance with Renishaw to ensure safe processing, and the appropriate processing parameters are used, if available. Renishaw powders have been tested and validated for use in the AM250/AM400 system.  \n\nSuccessful part production depends upon the system being properly serviced and maintained, and the use of Renishaw process parameters.  \n\nWhere Renishaw materials and process parameters are NOT used users must satisfy themselves that the necessary material validation is carried out. Renishaw cannot be held liable for performance when third party materials or process parameters are used.  \n\nWhere non Renishaw metal powder is being used, always refer to the applicable Safety Data Sheets and carry out a risk assessment before using the non-Renishaw metal powder. As an example, nonRenishaw metal powder may produce laser spectral emissions that exceed the specification of the glass panel fitted to the door on the AM250/AM400 system, this must be risk assessed and the risks understood before using the non-Renishaw powder.  \n\n# 8.7 Improper use  \n\nAnything that contravenes or is not specifically mentioned in this manual can be described as improper use, in particular the following:  \n\n1.\t The use of non-approved or highly toxic metal powders and"

For system servicing purposes, Renishaw requires full knowledge of all the materials that have been used in the system in order to protect our staff.   \n2.\t The removal of system components and/or the operation of system components in a position other than the one prescribed for them.   \n3.\t Warning and safety instructions not properly maintained.   \n4.\t Modifications to hardware components that have not been authorised by Renishaw.   \n5.\t Modifications to software elements that have not been authorised by Renishaw.   \n6.\t Operation without argon shielding gas.   \n7.\t Disabling the safety devices.  \n\n# 8.8 Handling of metal powders  \n\nWARNING: ALWAYS RISK ASSESS THE HANDLING OF METAL POWDERS, INCLUDING BUT NOT RESTRICTED TO: CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF THE APPROPRIATE SAFETY DATA SHEET, THE PROCESSES THAT WILL BE FOLLOWED, APPLICABLE LEGISLATION, LOCAL RULES, ETC.  \n\nSome metal powders are reactive and spontaneously form a hard, protective oxide film on contact with oxygen. This oxygen may be in the form of a gas (air, for instance), or in some other form, for example water.  \n\nThis ability to rapidly oxidise imparts the need for careful handling, as the potential for fire exists, because the oxidation of the powders gives off heat and, in some cases, explosive gas and is therefore potentially volatile and self-sustaining. Avoid disturbing the powder, particularly in an oxygen rich atmosphere. Risk assess any powders by careful examination of the appropriate Safety Data Sheet.  \n\n# 8.9 Toxicity/personnel exposure  \n\nSome metal powders may be harmful to health. This can only be ascertained by consulting the Safety Data Sheet and once again going through the risk assessment procedure and taking note of the guidance and procedures. In general, metal powders create a family of hazards (harmful or not), for example:  \n\n1.\t Fine airborne solids can create a nuisance dust and prolonged exposure may cause lung irritation. Many powders have a maximum permissible Workplace Exposure Limit of $0 . 5 ~ \\mathrm { m g } / \\mathrm { m } ^ { 3 }$ (WEL 8-hr limit). The recommended Workplace Exposure Limit will be indicated on the Safety Data Sheet for each respective powder.   \n2. Eye"

The recommended Workplace Exposure Limit will be indicated on the Safety Data Sheet for each respective powder.   \n2. Eye contact may cause irritation and burning. In the event of such exposure, the procedure indicated on the Safety Data Sheet should be followed.   \n3.\t Similarly, if skin is exposed, the procedure indicated in the Safety Data Sheet should be followed.   \n4.\t If large quantities of powder are inhaled, the procedure indicated in the Safety Data Sheet should be followed.  \n\n# 8.10 Flammability  \n\nMetal powders burn rapidly and at elevated temperatures and can produce very noxious gases. Metal powder in layers or in bulk may catch fire and burn if subject to a sufficiently energetic ignition source. Airborne suspensions above the limits indicated in the Safety Data Sheet can pose a dust explosion hazard. Minimum ignition values for a range of powders are available on request.  \n\n# 8.11 Fire-fighting  \n\nDo not place yourself at risk. In all cases when tackling a fire, the first action is to call the emergency services. At all stages, the fire-fighting method must be appropriate for the material concerned and the Safety Data Sheet should be consulted before assigning particular fire-fighting equipment to the areas where the materials are stored and used.  \n\nIn all cases, Renishaw recommends that specialist fire-fighting advice is sought before commencing operation of the system.  \n\nIn general, metal powder fires should be isolated and contained rather than extinguished. This can usually be accomplished by surrounding the fire with an inert material such as sand, salt or using a type D powder fire extinguisher.  \n\n# WARNING: DO NOT USE WATER OR PRESSURISED FIRE EXTINGUISHERS, AS THERE IS A RISK THAT THE METAL POWDER COULD BE FORCED INTO DUST CLOUD.  \n\nAlways use caution when cleaning up burned metal powder, as re-ignition of unburned material is possible.  \n\nWARNING: USING WATER ON SOME TYPES OF BURNING METALS MAY RESULT IN THE RELEASE OF EXPLOSIVE HYDROGEN GAS.  \n\n# WARNING: IN ALL CASES OF FIRE, CALL THE EMERGENCY SERVICES AND ADVISE ON THE EXACT NATURE OF THE MATERIALS BEING PROCESSED AND THOSE IN STORAGE.  \n\n# 8.12 Handling and processing  \n\nAvoid contact of metal powders with potential ignition sources (for example flames or sparks).  \n\nSpills – see Section 8.14 \"Spills\".  \n\n• Ensure that any vacuuming of powder is kept to a minimum quantity – ideally only vacuum what"

Brushing must only be done with non-sparking tools and avoiding the creation of a dust cloud, see Section 8.14 – \"Spills\". Only ever use an ATEX vacuum cleaner (wet separator) approved for use with combustible metal dusts.  \n\nStagnation points should be minimised.  \n\nGood housekeeping measures should be implemented and adhered to with regular and thorough cleaning regimes in place at all times.  \n\nGenerating airborne dust clouds of metal powder must be avoided.  \n\nAvoid the creating of static sparks – the use of static-dissipative footwear or inserts is recommended.  \n\nMethods of transport of metal powders are dependent on the type of material. Consult the Safety Data Sheet. Note that original containers may have been inert gas purged.  \n\nAll hazardous shipments need to quote a hazardous material classification code (UN / US Department of Transport) and a proper shipping name.  \n\nMetal powders may be subject to export control regulations, which may restrict shipment to some countries.  \n\n# 8.13 Storage  \n\nGenerally, metal powder should be stored in a cool dry place in hermetically sealed non-flammable containers away from ignition sources. Bulk storage should be in accordance with local building and fire codes. Consider zone-classified storage cabinets. Refer to the Safety Data Sheet.  \n\n# 8.14 Spills  \n\nAvoid contact of spilled material with greases, oils, solvents or combustibles. • Spills of powder should be immediately cleaned-up by gentle sweeping using a non-synthetic brush into a metal receptacle (anti-static dustpan and brush).  \n\nSmall amounts of residual material may be removed using an ATEX vacuum cleaner (wet separator) approved for use with combustible metal dusts.

The user must review the Safety Data Sheet and ensure that the correct handling procedures are followed. Combustible metal powders must be used, stored and disposed of in non-sparking (anti-static) o approved containers. Powder must be stored in sealed dry container, damp or humid power may give off flammable hydrogen gas. Containers containing combustible metal powders must be labelled to identify a Flammable Solid. Combustible metal powder must not be stored in plastic bags because of the possibility of electrostatic discharge. Always keep combustible metal powders away from any sources of ignition. • When cleaning up spills of combustible metal powders, ensure that the cleaning equipment is safe to use.  \n\nNever use compressed air to clean spills or residual traces of combustible metal powder. This could cause an explosive cloud to form.   \nDo not brush combustible metal powders for long distances, as this could cause electrostatic charges to be formed.   \nWe recommend the following safety equipment:   \nATEX vacuum cleaner (wet separator), suitable for use with combustible metal powder with a ga ventilation capability.   \nWashbasin with eye washing station.   \nNon-sparking containers for the storage of waste powder residues.  \n\n# 11.4 Inert gas safety  \n\n# WARNING: THE CONCENTRATION OF INERT GAS IN THE AMBIENT AIR NEEDS TO BE MONITORED AND LOW OXYGEN CONCENTRATION $( < 1 9 . 5 \\% )$ INDICATED BY A VISIBLE AND AUDIBLE WARNING DEVICE.  \n\nThe Renishaw AM250/AM400 is designed to consume minimal amounts of inert gas. It is possible to use either argon or nitrogen to create an inert atmosphere but the AM250/AM400 has been qualified using argon gas only. As a consequence of this low gas consumption, our recommendation is to use argon gas, which offers the additional benefit of being compatible with materials that are nitrogen reactive.  \n\n# WARNING: IT IS POSSIBLE THAT NITROGEN GAS MAY GIVE YOU BUILD RESULTS WHICH ARE MORE SUITABLE FOR YOUR ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING APPLICATION. THE AM250/AM400 HAS BEEN QUALIFIED USING ARGON GAS AND RENISHAW RECOMMEND THE USE OF ARGON GAS DURING BUILDS. THE USE OF NITROGEN IN THE AM250/AM400 IS AT THE RISK OF THE END USER OF THE AM250/AM400 SYSTEM.  \n\nA small amount of inert gas is emitted from the sieving station and AM250/AM400 system when in use.

THE USE OF NITROGEN IN THE AM250/AM400 IS AT THE RISK OF THE END USER OF THE AM250/AM400 SYSTEM.  \n\nA small amount of inert gas is emitted from the sieving station and AM250/AM400 system when in use. On the AM250/AM400 system, it is possible to connect the argon vent port to a connection outside the building to deal with gas emitted whilst the working chamber is being prepared.  \n\nArgon gas is odourless, heavier than air and as it displaces oxygen, is an asphyxiant. This creates a potential hazard and, although the concentration of argon gas under normal operation is low, there is a potential danger of suffocation. On this basis, Renishaw recommends that the room is well ventilated in accordance with the guidance in the installation section of this manual and also in accordance with local regulations.  \n\nUnder normal use with argon, ground level oxygen level monitoring is advised.  \n\nWARNING: ARGON GAS CYLINDERS ARE HEAVY. ENSURE GAS CYLINDERS ARE CORRECTLY SECURED TO PREVENT THEM FROM FALLING OVER. USE SUITABLE EQUIPMENT AND PROCESSES TO MOVE CYLINDERS. CONSIDER CONTACTING YOUR ARGON GAS SUPPLIER FOR EQUIPMENT, INFORMATION AND ADVICE ON HANDLING GAS CYLINDERS.  \n\n# 11.5 Build plate materials  \n\nIdeally all build plates should be indelibly marked (for example engraved or stamped) on the edge of the plate to indicate their material composition.  \n\nPlates are to be cleaned-up after use by grinding, milling or turning. The cleaned-up plates should maintain a tolerance of $5 0 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ for flatness and parallelism over their thickness, and a surface finish of up to $1 . 6 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ Ra (ground finish).  \n\nIt is particularly important to ensure that the underside of the build plate is not convex, as this can have a detrimental effect on the flatness of the upper working face when installed in the system. This can lead to failed builds because of uneven powder distribution on the initial layers and poor adhesion to the plate.  \n\nAfter machining, all cutting fluid residue must be removed using an appropriate cleaning medium.   \nNormally ethanol or isopropanol is sufficient.  \n\nBuild plate thickness must be measured prior to final fixing onto the build table. Failure to input the correct thickness value may result in damage to the system or process inconsistency.  \n\nDepending on the application a build plate thicker than standard may be required, to ensure the internal stress in the part is adequately resisted – this is typically only when very large and particularly dense parts are fabricated.

It is located within the framework of the system. Further information about the laser can be obtained from Renishaw upon request.  \n\n# 13.5 Chiller  \n\nA chiller (supplied with the system) maintains a stable temperature for the laser and optical system. It is imperative that the chiller is maintained in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions and that a suitable anti-fungal inhibitor is used. See Section 14.1 \"Chiller\". There are two sizes of chiller, the size of chiller supplied depends upon the AM system supplied.  \n\n# 13.6 Beam aperture protective window  \n\nThe F-Theta lens focuses the laser beam on to the metal powder surface on the substrate plate housed in the top chamber. For AM250 the lens protective cover should only be cleaned by following the procedure as detailed in section 30.4. For AM250 with PlusPac and AM400 the WPS (Window Protection System) should only be cleaned by following the procedure as detailed in section 30.5.  \n\nA cleaning kit is available from Renishaw – see Appendix B \"Part numbers of spares\" for details of the kit and its contents.  \n\n# 13.7 Viewing window  \n\nThe main chamber door of the build volume features a viewing window and a protective insert. This meets the standard ANSI Z136.1 – 2007 and is specified to protect against scattered laser radiation for the wavelength used in the AM250/AM400. The viewing port is located in the door of the top chamber and in this application permits a Class 1 laser specification to be achieved.  \n\n# 13.8 Loading metal powder using powder bottles  \n\nMetal powder of the correct particle size should be loaded from the supplier’s containers into small powder bottles using a mask, gloves and eye protection as detailed in the safety section of this manual.  \n\n# WARNING: DO NOT LOAD POWDER DIRECTLY FROM THE SUPPLIERS CONTAINER INTO THE AM250/AM400 – POWDER MUST FIRST BE DECANTED INTO A POWDER BOTTLE.

(These are designed and manufactured on request depending on the supplier’s container type.)  \n\nThe Renishaw powder bottles are sealed with a butterfly valve and can be used to load material into the system. The large powder bottle is a large capacity vessel designed to collect excess powder. It is located in the lower part of the side access door alongside the safe change filter. To empty, connect it to a small powder bottle to decant material. Only the small powder bottle (part number 796531000) should be fitted to the sieving station following a build.  \n\n# WARNING: THE FULL LARGE POWDER BOTTLE IS HEAVY (UP TO 40 KG (88 LB) DEPENDING ON MATERIAL) – USE SUITABLE MANUAL HANDLING PROCEDURES.  \n\n# 13.9 Loading the powder silo  \n\nThe AM250/AM400 features a removable silo arrangement; this can be exchanged for a cleaned or powder-specific unit when changing powders. An overhead crane or gantry with a minimum lifting capacity of $2 0 0 ~ \\mathsf { k g }$ is required when removing the silo. Renishaw recommend using a Renishaw silo changeover lift part number A-5771-1000, (Figure 59).  \n\nLoading powder into the silo requires a small powder bottle to be fitted to the top of the silo. Two valves are required – one to isolate the bottle (A1) and one to isolate the silo (V1).  \n\nThe silo can be refilled whilst a build is in process, but not until the initial vacuum and inert cycle has completed.  \n\n![](images/6d93e4599ef02e49356470e5ebf12b48fc706f385137b1deb5a48da5d81b0bfc.jpg)  \nFigure 59 Renishaw silo lift  \n\n# WARNING: DO NOT ATTEMPT TO FILL THE SILO WHIL"

A separate user manual is available for this device. The integration in to the AM250/AM400 gives a reading down to the point at which the silo meets the main chamber. The silo volume is non-linear and, as such, the calibration curve programmed into the sensor incorporates an allowance for this. The system can be configured to pause at a given level via the user interface.  \n\n# 13.11 Powder delivery  \n\nThe powder delivery mechanism is situated inside the chamber and dispenses a dose of metal powder on to the base of the top chamber process plate. The mechanism can be configured to vary the amount of powder dosed. The percentage dosage can be entered using the HMI touch screen, see Section 27.5 \"Setting the dosing percentage\".  \n\n# 13.12 Wiper assembly  \n\nThe wiper assembly, (Figure 60) comprises the wiper arm, pulleys and toothed belts concealed behind sheet metal covers. The wiper traverses the base of the top chamber, distributing a uniform layer of metal powder over the top of the substrate plate. Excess powder is discharged through front and rear apertures in the process plate.  \n\n![](images/ec0e7df90d6934ae6e7c055476f698a7aad35ebf0fbdd5a5e29d0ffa6b649fca.jpg)  \nFigure 60 Wiper assembly  \n\n# 13.13 Gas circuit  \n\nOn the AM250 system gas enters the build chamber from the lower right hand side of the chamber.

The filter housing containing the filter element can be accessed through the left hand door, isolated and removed for replacement.  \n\nOn AM250 systems fitted with PlusPac and on AM400 systems, the gas circuit has additional pipework fitted to the top of the build chamber to more efficiently direct the flow of gas.  \n\nOn AM250 systems fitted with PlusPac and on AM400 systems, there is an option to control the flow of gas across the build plate when the system is dosing powder. If enabled, flow regulation decreases the output of the recirculation pump whilst the doser is delivering powder into the build chamber and whilst the wiper is distributing this powder across the build plate. Flow regulation is enabled in Level 4 login. The reduction in recirculation output is configurable in Level 2 login, and by default is set to a $50 \\%$ reduction. If a value outside the normal range is entered an error message wil be shown.  \n\n# 13.14 Build plate  \n\nThe build plate is the surface upon which the build process takes place. It is bolted onto the top surface of the table housed in the bottom chamber using M5 cap screws. It then gets covered by progressive layers of metal powder. The powder is selectively melted, fusing it first to the substrate then to the previous layer to create a homogeneous solid component. Each powder type requires a compatible substrate material. See Section 36 Appendix A \"AM250/AM400 build plate drawings\", for build plate requirements.  \n\n# 13.15 Heating/temperature control  \n\nThere are heaters built into the table which can be used to heat the substrate plate. The temperature can be set in degrees on the thermostat ( $1 7 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathsf { C }$ max ( $3 3 8 ^ { \\circ } \\mathsf { F }$ max)) via the HMI touch screen.  \n\n# 13.16 Safe change filter and large safe change filter  \n\nThe system features a recirculating gas flow across the build area, flowing from right to left.

The filtered inert gas is then re-circulated through the system to maintain extremely low oxygen content. The filter housing can be isolated using the upper and lower valves (V4 and V5) and then removed by releasing the two KF40 flanges.  \n\nFollowing removal of the safe change or large safe change filter housing, it must be made inert by filling with water, and placed into a vented drum full of water and a $5 \\%$ solution of Hydra-Sol-MAG additive (P-LU08-0004) – see Section 22 – \"Safe change or large safe change filter\".  \n\nPlease seek advice from your local waste disposal provider; details of the contaminants for a range of materials can be provided on request.  \n\n# 13.17 Oxygen monitoring sensors  \n\nThe oxygen levels in the chamber and the gas recirculation circuit are continuously monitored at two separate points in the system gas circuit. If the oxygen level exceeds the maximum value set in the user interface, the system will add inert gas. The process will pause briefly until the required level is achieved.  \n\nIn practice, oxygen levels are generally maintained well below 500 ppm (parts per million) or $0 . 0 5 \\%$ .

The chiller is a closed-loop cooling circuit and has a direct communication connection to the system that allows status and warnings to be viewed via the HMI touch screen.  \n\nRegular weekly checks are required to ensure that the chiller fluid level is maintained – it should not be allowed to drop below the L mark on the sight glass (Figure 61). The chiller cooling circuit can be filled with either Glycol or Nalco fluid. Using Glycol requires the use of a corrosion inhibitor / fungicide which is available from your local Renishaw office. Glycol is a concentrated solution and is mixed with purified filtered water at a concentration of $2 5 \\%$ by volume. Description – Glycol chiller additive. Part number: P-HX04-0001.

The potential for powder explosion due to static charge caused by powder in suspension. To control and mitigate this hazard, an ATEX vacuum cleaner (wet separator) is used to extinguish any potential ignition whilst the material is vacuumed.   \n2.

For the ventilation valve to function effectively, it is essential to store the ATEX vacuum cleaner (wet separator) in a well ventilated area. c. Use of a $5 \\%$ solution of Hydra-Sol-MAG additive (P-LU08-0004) in the ATEX vacuum cleaner (wet separator) will help to inhibit the generation of hydrogen.  \n\nThe Renishaw supplied and approved ATEX vacuum cleaner (wet separator) is a Ruwac NA7 (Figure 34) (earlier installations may also be using the Ruwac NA35).  \n\nThe manufacturer’s user manual for the Ruwac NA7 is supplied, and should be read before use. Key points are listed below:  \n\n# 14.2.1 ATEX vacuum cleaner (wet separator) safety checks  \n\n![](images/12cd7f4c32f6c30d44806c9cfb66fac48abfc5acb45ccb7a1f43726b26b508f3.jpg)  \n\nEnsure the ATEX vacuum cleaner (wet separator) is electrically earthed.   \n< 106 Ohms between plug and components.   \n< 1 MOhm for conductive components.   \n< 108 Ohms for dissipative parts. Check fluid level is correct before every start-up, and top-up as necessary.   \nEnsure correct additives are used.  \n\n![](images/3f6407dae41095aec063858ce3ffe01f64c5656c18aba9702c0adbaf585710cc.jpg)  \n\n![](images/b4f6b4e2db569392d94f8537a004757dfa0d307e8ecec4c6a4803ab696d9bc0a.jpg)  \n\nCheck the hydrogen ventilation valve(s) work before start-up by pressing and ensuring they spring back (open).  \n\n![](images/76446d6917ecd905d393f884f2eeb55d7f5b6c86ce98383d7469f47e45e09b53.jpg)  \n\nEnsure the ATEX vacuum cleaner (wet separator) is emptied and cleaned after every shift.  \n\nThese checks must be carried out on both the Ruwac NA35 and NA7 models.  \n\nEnsure the ATEX vacuum cleaner (wet separator) is electrically earthed.  \n\nCheck"

Check the resistance of the plug earthing (largest diameter pin) against the body. If a reading greater than 1 MOhm (open circuit) is detected between any component, the unit must be disassembled and checked.  \n\nRuwac recommends that an insulation tester is used with a voltage of $2 5 0 \\vee$ ; however a low voltage multimeter should be sufficient. Renishaw recommends that this is checked at least after every disassembly or weekly if no disassembly occurs.  \n\nEnsure the fluid level is checked before every start-up and the correct additives are used.  \n\nThis can be easily checked through the window of the Ruwac NA7, however the NA35 must be disassembled to check.  \n\nUsers must have completed the appropriate Renishaw training course before handling oxygen reactive metals. Among other recommendations this will specify the need to add a $5 \\%$ solution of Hydra-SolMAG additive (part number P-LU08-0004) to the Ruwac ATEX vacuum cleaner (wet separator).  \n\n![](images/727548cd9e471d0037c1ac1b94249dc1ccaa153665a5b2c93650c099f7c77ef3.jpg)  \nFigure 67 Ruwac NA7 ATEX vacuum cleaner (wet separator)  \n\nDepending on the metal powder (particularly aluminium alloy) and local water hardness it may also be necessary to add $0 . 1 \\%$ by volume of anti-foaming agent (part number 792322000). It is essential that foam is not allowed to build up as it will be drawn into the cleaner resulting in corrosion.  \n\nEnsure the ventilation valve(s) are checked before start-up  \n\nNote that the ventilation valve is designed to close when in use. First, turn off the Ruwac ATEX vacuum cleaner (wet separator). Push the inner disk (Figure 68 and Figure 69). It should move approximately $5 \\mathsf { m m }$ and spring back (open) – if no movement is detected the valve is stuck. Immediately quarantine the Ruwac ATEX vacuum cleaner (wet separator) by placing it in a well ventilated area away from possible ignition sources.  \n\nContact Renishaw for replacement parts.  \n\nEnsure"

NOFORMAL LICENCE OR TRAINING IS REQUIRED TO OPERATE THE SILO LIFT, BUT RENISHAWSTRONGLY ADVISE FAMILIARISATION TRAINING IS CARRIED OUT.  \n\nBefore using the silo lift, ensure that all functions are working correctly. • Never exceed the maximum permissible load for the silo lift and comply strictly with the requirements of the load diagram, on any equipment supplied. • Ensure that the load is evenly distributed. • Ensure that your silo lift is the correct type for the area you are to work in. Do not enter a hazardous zone with an unsuitable silo lift. • Do not carry divisible loads that sit higher than the fork carriage or backrest extension. • Keep a safe stopping distance. Laden silo lifts cannot be stopped as quickly. • If the silo lift develops a fault or feels unsafe, suspend operations, park and report. • The silo lift should not be left unattended on a gradient. • Be cautious of overhead limitations or obstructions.  \n\n# Driving and braking  \n\nThe silo lift is not fitted with any kind of drive or braking devices and so driving and braking are both controlled by the operator pushing the silo lift. The rear castors are fitted with foot brakes for parking purposes.  \n\n# Loading  \n\nThe forks are specifically designed to securely locate a silo, ensure the silo is pushed against the dead-stops, and fork tips located correctly.  \n\nWhen using the plate for general purpose lifting ensure it is fixed in place and the load appropriately located.  \n\n# Lifting  \n\nOperate the manual hand pump by moving the pump handle lever backwards and forward at full stroke. Lift is achieved by each stroke of the handle.  \n\n# Lowering  \n\nOpen the manual control valve by turning the release lever anti-clockwise.  \n\nThis lever can be set at any required angle by depressing the top button and revolving. It will lock automatically once the button has been released.  \n\nNote: The speed of lowering can be controlled directly through the degree of turn of the knob, the valve will spring shut once the lever is released and lowering will halt.  \n\nCaution: Always apply the wheel brakes when lifting or lowering a load.  \n\n# 14.4.2 Rated capacity  \n\nWARNING:"
